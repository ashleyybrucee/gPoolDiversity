# gPoolDiversity

Graph U-Nets considers the problem of representation learning for graph data [1]. Its methods propose pooling and unpooling operations, where the pooling layers (gPool) adaptively select nodes to form a smaller graph based on their scalar projection that best represents the original graph. In only examining the projection values, gPool neglects to maintain diversity in the sparsified graph: in particular, ensuring that nodes selected originate from diverse neighborhoods in the original graph. Our work addresses this shortcoming and we improve gPool in Graph U-Nets by using the Jaccard Coefficient to rank nodes based on their similarity in neighborhoods with other nodes which is then used to weigh the scalar projection values. When choosing nodes from diverse neighborhoods for pooling, we found that graph classification performance can improve or worsen depending on the network structure.
